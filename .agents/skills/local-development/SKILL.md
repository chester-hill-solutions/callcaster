# Local development

The single source of truth is `docs/local-development.md`. Read the relevant section before running commands; this skill only says where to look and which entry points exist.

## Entry points

- First run or repair: `make init` (`npm run setup`, idempotent). Services already running elsewhere: `npm run setup -- --skip-docker`.
- Services: `make up | down | logs | ps`; scope with a service name first (`make postgres logs`, `make postgres minio up`). Service names come from `docker-compose.dev.yml`.
- Processes: `make app` (dev server on :3000), `make worker` (job worker), `make media-stream`. Run each in its own terminal so its log stays visible.
- Checks: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run check:lint-ratchet`, `npm test`, `make e2e`. Node-tier tests need the node config: `npx vitest run -c vitest.node.config.ts <file>`; UI tests use `vitest.ui.config.ts`.

## Tailing logs

- Compose services: `make logs` or `make <service> logs` (follows, last 200 lines). One-shot: `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs --tail=100 postgres`.
- App and worker: they log JSON lines to the terminal they run in. Never pipe the worker through `head` or `tail` while it runs; redirect to a file and read that.
- Local Postgres is `127.0.0.1:5433` (`callcaster`/`callcaster`), MinIO console `:9001`, Inbucket `:9002`.

## Git in this repository

- `dev` is the trunk; `master` is the release branch and only moves by a dev → master release PR. Check `git log origin/dev` before starting an "open" issue: it may already be fixed.
- Create or update the GitHub issue before starting work. One issue, one concern, one PR; put `Closes #N` in the PR body, never close issues by hand.
- Every PR that changes behaviour adds a line under `## [Unreleased]` in `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
- Work in a worktree off `origin/dev` (`git worktree add <dir> -b <branch> origin/dev`); the main checkout is shared and can be reset under you. Commit each slice immediately.
- Merge on green with `gh pr merge N --squash --delete-branch`, then `git remote prune origin` and remove the worktree.
- Load the `github-cli` and `github-issues` skills for `gh` specifics.
